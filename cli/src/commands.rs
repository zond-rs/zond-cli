//! # Command Line Interface Definitions
//!
//! This module defines the strict schema for user input.
//!
//! It serves as the single source of truth for the application's command-line interface.
//! While the *execution* logic for each command resides in its own submodule (e.g., `scan/mod.rs`),
//! the *definition* of the arguments, flags, and help text is centralized here.
//!
//! ## Architectural Role
//!
//! This module performs two key architectural functions:
//!
//! 1.  **Input Normalization**: It uses `clap` to validate user inputs, making sure that necessary
//!     arguments are present and types are correct (e.g., strictly typed numbers vs strings)
//!     before the application attempts to run.
//! 2.  **State Translation**: via the `From<&CommandLine> for Config` implementation, it
//!     decouples the external interface (CLI flags) from the internal application state (`Config`).
//!     This allows the core libraries to remain agnostic of the user interface layer.
//!
//! ## Structure
//!
//! The CLI is structured hierarchically:
//!
//! * [`CommandLine`]: The top-level struct containing global flags applicable to the entire process
//!   (logging, formatting, verbosity).
//! * [`Commands`]: An enum representing the specific operation mode. Since these are mutually
//!   exclusive, the type system ensures the application cannot be in two states (e.g., "Scan"
//!   and "Listen") simultaneously.
